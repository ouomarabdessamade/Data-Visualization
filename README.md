# Data Visualization Project

## Overview
This project focuses on Data Visualization, where we have performed visualization and analysis on two distinct datasets.

### Immigration to Canada (1980-2013)
We have conducted data visualization on immigration to Canada using the dataset "Immigration to Canada from 1980 to 2013 - International migration flows to and from selected countries - The 2015 revision." The dataset contains annual data on the flows of international migrants, including both inflows and outflows, based on place of birth, citizenship, or place of previous/next residence for foreigners and nationals. For more details and insights, check the file [VisualisationImmigrationCanadaDataset.ipynb](VisualisationImmigrationCanadaDataset.ipynb). You can access the original dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ammaraahmad/immigration-to-canada).

### COVID-19 Dataset
We have also worked on a COVID-19 dataset, which contains information about the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and other relevant data per country and date. The dataset provides insights into the impact of the pandemic globally. For a detailed exploration, refer to the file [DataCovid19.ipynb](DataCovid19.ipynb).
